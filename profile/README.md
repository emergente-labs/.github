## About

Emergente Labs is a product engineering studio building high-reliability software for commerce and financial technology. We design, build, and operate the platforms behind **SellHub** and **MoneyMotion** &mdash; products that power real businesses at scale.

Our engineering culture is built around **type safety**, **functional programming**, and **observable systems**. We use [Effect-TS](https://effect.website) as our core runtime for building resilient, composable backend services deployed on Cloudflare's global edge network.
